# Degree Audit

## Idea
- Reshape how the degree audit works and looks when checking degree status.
  
- Be able to easily see past courses taken, as well as past semester GPA.

- Have a connection to your search to auto filter your classes
## Future Ideas
- Have a Multi-language option for users with diverse language backgrounds

- Develop the "Minor Requirements" section to allow for students with Minor degree paths to be able to see their status on the audit.
