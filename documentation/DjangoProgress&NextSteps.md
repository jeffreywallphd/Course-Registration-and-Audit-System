### Overview 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our first step was learning about Django and how it works and then we created the Django application through VS code. 
We used a combination of YouTube videos and classmate made tutorials to understand Django and to help us create the application.
The application was then added to the GitHub repository so we could collaborate on editing it. 
After the application was set up and on GitHub, we worked on connecting it to the database. The next steps for future groups are outlined below:

### 1. Set up HTML template and CSS pages and connect them   

  ### Home page  
  -  Connection to other pages and login page
  ### Login  
   - Separate login view for the user
   - Would consist of a username and password
   - Multiple ways to sign in such as: (sso, google account, or regular email)
  - Create a guest account
  ### Search/Browse  
  - Can view all the classes left to take and the ones they have already taken 
  - Displays which semesters they are offered  
  ### Filtering process 
  - The degree audit will be used in the filtering process 
  - Future idea: Use AI to make recommendations for the student based on their proposed schedule and major   
 ### Calendar  
   - The calendar will be used for students to see if there are any scheduling conflicts
   - User can see how their schedule would look like and be compatible with Google Calendar to download or add the calendar 
### 2. Export designs from Figma  
   - Export HTML, & CSS for each page
   - Switch into developer mode to be able to see that feature
   - Click on the slide you are interested in exported and choose the format
### 3. Begin integrating code from Figma 
   - Assign & Deligate Work Evenly
     - Determine which team and specific individuals will be working on the implementation of each page
     - Before fully developing any code, meetings about an agreed color pallete and style guide should be made
     - Weekly meetings to go over the UI expectations should occur to make sure that each team is on the same page
       
   - Build the foundational aspects of these pages
     - Make a global.css or index.css page
     - Complete the index.html page
     - Make HTML pages for the rest of the designs needed
       
### 4. Set up specific features 
  ### Search Bar 
  - Look up classes by course number, course name, or professor
  - Look up information on professors, be connected to RateMyProfessor
  - Look up information about different degrees 
  - Automatically apply how many credits they would need to compelete for any major/current major 
  ### Filter   
  - Viewing the courses and selecting them after filtering 
  - Being able to add selected courses to the calendar
  ### Calendar  
  - View of the calendar 
  - Functionality of the calendar 
### Degree Audit View   
  - View of the degree audit 
  - Functionality of degree audit view
