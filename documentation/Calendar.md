# Calendar Page
This is the documentation regarding the Calendar on the mockup
## Idea
The idea for the calendar page is to be a calendar system for students to see their classes and what day/time they would fall on. With this, students would be able to see the classes they have in their cart as well as the classes they have registered for. For the classes, they will have an eye next to each class to be able to turn the class "on and off" if they want to see it on their calendar.
