# Cart View
This is the documentation regarding the Cart View section on the mockup
## Idea
The idea for the cart view was for there to be another option between looking for classes and registering for them. This would be an option for students to add as many classes as they are interested in into their cart so they can see all of them side by side and see which one fits better in their schedule or what sounds more appealing.

Once the classes are in the cart there will be a button to remove them from the cart or directly register from there. The point of this is to make it easier and less stressful for the students by making it easier to navigate and find classes that suit the student's interests by being able to see them all side by side. Each class in the cart will show the day, time, and gist of the class with key points, such as if it is primarily project or exam-focused.
