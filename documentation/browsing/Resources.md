Upon our research of other universities' course searches, we started to gather information on the advantages and disadvantages of these university's course search pages. The two universities whose course search websites were visually appealing were Yale and Michigan State. While on the websites, the user experience was fluid, and information regarding the classes was easily accessible. When analyzing Harvardâ€™s webpage, we targeted various aspects that we will look to avoid when structuring our website. Making sure that the website is visually appealing to the user, while also providing adequate information will be crucial. We were able to pinpoint multiple different aspects that we will implement in our user interface design and overall website structure.
